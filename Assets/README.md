# 05-work-day-scheduler

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN the user opens the planner
THEN the user is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
The user can enter an event
WHEN the user clicks the save button for that timeblock nothing will happen
THEN the text for that event is not saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page THEN all the events are removed

thats as far as I got...back to the videos and tutorials
