## USER STORY

- AS AN employee with a busy schedule
- I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
- SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

<br>

---

## DESCRIPTION

This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It also uses [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) for time and date related components.

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
